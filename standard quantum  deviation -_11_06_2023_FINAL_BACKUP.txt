SQD



STANDARD QUANTUM DEVIATION


What is the STANDARD, ----> SQD


Which universe? which location universe, which version by dimensions?

if this universe, around what regions with what time era's.

ex.
Blackholes

ex. TIME BOMB

Ex. two suns

Ex. 5 suns.

Ex5. ALL THE SUNS returns at once :(


Value Proposition - - - - > > > > We have to wait as long as one or more SQD's need to be.


THESE ARE YING YANG conservation of time "events"





DEFINTION:  A standard quantum deviation is a ying yang conservation of time event.

		-it varies in  description of an SI unit length lol because space is relative to it's surroundings
		including things that dilate time like, suns, blackholes, and impatience.
